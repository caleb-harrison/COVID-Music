# COVID-TEMPO

Web application to calculate a selected state's positive case rate based on its 3 previous day's data, then match the rate with a song from Spotify that matches it by tempo.

This project uses:
- Python
- Streamlit
- CovidTracking API
- Spotify API

The goal of this project is to give a familiar sound to data that isn't so easy to grasp the magnitude of. In some states where the positive case rate is higher, we may hear death metal while in other states, it may be slow lullaby songs.

We can beat this virus together.
